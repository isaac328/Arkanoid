## Arkanoid

This program is a clone of the game Arkanoid. The ball bounces off the player controlled paddle
                        and hits blocks which then disappear. This game was built as more of a demo, as a result the player cannot
                        win or lose. Controls are A and D to move left and right, respectively.
